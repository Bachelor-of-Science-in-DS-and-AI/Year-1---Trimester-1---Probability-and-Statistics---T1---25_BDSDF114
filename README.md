### ✅ <b> Course Description </b>

<b> Welcome to the Probability and Statistics course! </b>

This course provides an elementary introduction to probability and statistics with applications. In this course, you will be introduced to data sets, Chebyshev’s inequality, and descriptive statistics. You will learn about the axioms of probability, Bayes’ formula, random variables, mathematical expectations, and types of distribution and coverage of estimation with confidence intervals. You will also be introduced to hypothesis testing. After completing this course, you will be able to use probability and statistics effectively and apply the concepts and methods learned to real-world problems. 

### ✅ <b> Course Learning Objectives </b>

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- Explain the statistical summary of the dataset and the probability concepts, such as conditional probability and Bayes’s formula.
- Define the concepts of a random variable: discrete and continuous, expectation, variance, and moment-generating function.
- Apply the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem and demonstrate the concept of interval estimation and confidence intervals
- Validate the hypothesis using a t-test, z-test, and chi-square test and set the least square fit of data to a model. </p>
